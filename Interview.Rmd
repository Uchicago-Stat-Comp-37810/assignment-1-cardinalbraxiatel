#Andrea: A Life Examined

1. In the Beginning
Born in Beijing, China she would spend her time there until she decided to move to the United States to pursue higher education.

2. Education
Andrea attended Northwestern University where she obtained a Bachelor of Arts in *Economics and Mathematical Methodologies in the Social Sciences,* which she often shortens to a less impressive title.
  Her programming skills specifically are best described as an accomplished amateur in Python and R.

3. Hobbies
Andrea enjoys backpacking and all sorts of hiking as well as eating which I'm sure we can all agree on.

4. The Future
Alhtough Andrea of course has professional goals of attaining a higher level of employment, she also has a personal goal: to visit all 7 continents before she is 35.

5. Favorite Mathematical Formula
$(1 + 2 + 3 ... +N)^2 = (1^3  + 2^3 + 3^3 ... + N^3)$

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(c(1:7),c(3,2,3,4,2,3,4), main = "Number of Meals per Day", xlab = "Day of Week", ylab = "Number of Meals")
