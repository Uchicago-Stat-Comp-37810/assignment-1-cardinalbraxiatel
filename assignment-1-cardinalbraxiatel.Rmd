  ratio[i] <- Fibonacci[i]/Fibonacci[i-1]

    break}}
  plot(2:31, ratio[2:31], main = "Convergence of Nth Fibonacci Ratio", xlab = "N", ylab = "Ratio")
  abline(h = GR)
  #although not quite a proof, by Johannes Kepler's proof
  # that the limit of this ratio at the nth observation (as 
  # n goes to infinity) the ratio will converge to the 
  # golden ratio. According to R, the floating point differences
  # between the ratio and the GR vanishes and the series
  # essentially converges. The line below indicates the Golden Ratio.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
